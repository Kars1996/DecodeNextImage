# Decode Next/Image Urls

This is a simple python project (might turn into a NPM package for funs) to simply decode the next/image url and turn it into the source URL
This is built out of spite because [clerk](https://clerk.com) has really cool changelog images but next/image only gives lower quality images
To use run main.py and follow input. Thanks
